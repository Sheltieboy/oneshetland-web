/**
 * listing-tiers.ts — THE tier model. One map decides what every tier gets,
 * everywhere: public listing richness, management page access, and the plan
 * comparison on the marketing page.
 *
 * ⚠️ KEEP IN SYNC with oneshetland-delivers/lib/listing-tiers.ts — there is no
 * shared package, so this file is mirrored across the app and web repos. If you
 * change the tier ladder or feature map here, make the identical change there.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS THE ONLY PLACE.
 * "What does a tier get?" used to be answered in four places that disagreed —
 * PLAN_FEATURES, FEATURE_MIN_TIER, LISTING_LADDER and nine hand-written
 * tierMeets() gates — plus an add-on system that billed but never enforced. A
 * business could fully manage Events on Free and then find them hidden on its
 * own listing. Everything now derives from TIER_FEATURES below, so the four
 * cannot drift apart again. See docs/tier-model.md.
 *
 * THE PRINCIPLE. The island's shared sections are free; your own trading
 * operation is paid. What's On and Work only work if they are full, so Jobs and
 * Events are free — an event has value to Shetland even if no ticket sells. A
 * shop does not.
 *
 * Listing features govern DISPLAY only and must not drive any in-app purchase
 * flow (App Store compliance — selling is web-only). A business is shown
 * everything its tier unlocks that it has legitimately filled in; higher-tier
 * elements are omitted for lower tiers, empty ones for everyone.
