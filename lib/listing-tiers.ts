 * listing-tiers.ts — single source of truth for how RICH a business's public

 *
 * ⚠️ KEEP IN SYNC with oneshetland-delivers/lib/listing-tiers.ts — there is no
 * shared package, so this file is mirrored across the app and web repos. If you
 * change the tier ladder or feature map here, make the identical change there.
 *
 * This only governs DISPLAY richness of the public listing page. It does NOT
 * sell anything and must not drive any in-app purchase flow (App Store
 * compliance — selling is web-only). A business is shown everything its current
 * tier unlocks that it has legitimately filled in; higher-tier-only elements are
 * simply omitted for lower tiers, and empty ones are omitted for everyone.
