 * IMPORTANT: this is the *published timetable*, not a live feed. Times are the
 * last GUARANTEED turn-up sailing FROM the Mainland terminal TO each island —
 * we deliberately do NOT headline booking-only late sailings (marked * on the
 * SIC timetables), because those don't run unless pre-booked and quoting them
 * could strand someone. Always shown with a "timetabled times" caveat.

 * Source: Shetland Islands Council inter-island ferry timetables
 *   - Yell/Unst/Fetlar — effective 4 Jul 2026
 *   - Bressay/Whalsay/Skerries/Papa Stour/Foula/Fair Isle — effective 6 Oct 2025
 *
 * Scope: the three single-leg commuter isles (Bressay, Whalsay, Yell). Multi-leg
 * (Unst/Fetlar via Yell) and booking-only routes (Skerries, Papa Stour, Foula,
 * Fair Isle) are intentionally omitted from the headline — see FERRY_MORE_INFO.
