/**
 * business-outcomes.ts — the five things a business owner is actually trying to do.
 *
 * Pure, derived on every load, stores nothing. Be found, sell things, take
 * bookings, run events, keep customers coming back. Everything else on the
 * business is either a system layer (money, growth) or a different product
 * (work).
 *
 * Two rules run through all of it.
 *
 * An unused capability is not unfinished work. A shop that has never wanted to
 * sell online is not 80% of a shop, so "available" is a calm, neutral, finished
 * state and never a task. Only NEEDS YOU raises its voice, and it is not this
 * file's job to compete with it.
 *
 * Live means live TO A CUSTOMER. A product flagged active on a business whose
 * Premium lapsed is not on sale — the read policy hides it — so calling it live
 * here would have Home disagree with the shop's own listing. Effective
 * entitlement decides, never the configured tier.
