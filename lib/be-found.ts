/**
 * be-found.ts — is this listing good enough for a customer to use?
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately not a score. 26% of the directory has a description
 * and 20% has opening hours, so a percentage would greet almost every claimed
 * import with "you are 20% complete" — a number that is discouraging, tells the
 * owner nothing about what to do, and never reaches 100 for a business that
 * legitimately has no website. Facts and an ordered list of gaps instead.
 *
 * name, category and address are NOT NULL on local_businesses, so they are
 * always present and are not milestones. What actually varies is the five
 * below.
 *
 * is_active is NOT read here, on purpose. It is moderation state with no owner
 * control on either platform, so it must never make an owner's listing look
 * unfinished for something they cannot do anything about.
