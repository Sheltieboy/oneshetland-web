 * Deterministic, ordered, first match wins, one result. No score, no model, no
 * upgrade advertising. An owner should never be sold a plan by a surface whose
 * job is to tell them what to do.
 *
 * The most important rule is the first one: if real work is waiting — an order,
 * a booking, a job lead, an application — there is no "next". Suggesting they
 * write a description while four customers wait would be insulting, and showing
 * "4 orders waiting" in two places at once teaches people to ignore both.
 * DashboardTop already owns that layer, so this defers to it rather than
 * forming a second, subtly different opinion about what counts as attention.
